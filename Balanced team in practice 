To build a successful product, we need to answer three questions:

Will it solve users’ problems?
Will it help our business?
Can we build it well?
Lean startup, user-centered design, and agile/XP help us identify the best answers to these questions. When we work within the
construct of a balanced team, we ensure that all of these perspectives blend and inform each other.

Desirability: Will it solve users’ problems?

The product should be something that users want and that solves real problems. A designer’s primary question is, “How is the user
affected?” More than anyone else on the team, designers help us answer these fundamental questions: “Is this a problem worth solving
for users?” and, “Does this design solve the problem?”

Caution: If designers become too focused on user needs and cannot connect with business needs and technical feasibility, they’ll focus
on solution ideas that can’t be implemented or won’t deliver a return on investment.

Viability: Will it help our business?

The product has to support a sustainable business model. The product manager’s primary question is, “By solving these specific user
problems with these specific solutions, are we creating valuable user and business outcomes?”

Caution: If product managers become too focused on the business and cannot connect with users, they’ll likely focus on solutions that
don’t solve any real needs, and thus don’t get used.

Feasibility: Can we build it well?

Product implementation has to be feasible and robust. Engineers’ primary question is, “What technical implementation will best satisfy
the project and product goals?” Engineers help us debate the feasibility and merit of potential solutions while remaining mindful of
technology constraints.

Caution: It doesn’t help for engineers to come up with feasible solutions that don’t solve problems for users; that’s not developing good
software. And if we home in on a solution that’s desirable and viable yet not feasible, we’ve failed.
